# General
- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials?** <br/>
  Yes. All AC215 / CSCIE-115 students have access to all the video captured materials.
- **Is there a GitHub repo for the class?**<br/>
  Yes. [https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2021-AC215](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2021-AC215) 
- **Does the individual Exercise (EX) mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner?**<br/>
  You are supposed to work on your own, and you should not work with a partner. You can ask questions at Office Hours (OHs) and use all of your materials from the course up to the EX.
- **I am an Extension School Student, can I participate to the forum discussion? And do they count towards my grade?**<br/>
  All AC215 students - both Extension and Non-Extension- have access and should participate to the forum discussion. No grades for participating in discussion forums. 

# Auditors
- **Can I audit this course?**<br/>
  This course is based on frequent interactions among teaching staff and students. Given the nature of the class and remote teaching, our policy is not to allow auditors.
