All AC215 / CSCIE-115 students have access to all the video captured materials. Is there a GitHub repo for the class? Yes. https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2021-AC215 Does the individual Exercise (EX) mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner? You are supposed to work on your own, and you should not work with a partner. You can ask questions at Office Hours (OHs) and use all of your materials from the course up to the EX. I am an Extension School Student, can I participate in the discussion forum? And do they count towards my grade? All AC215 students - both Extension and Non-Extension- have access and should participate to the forum discussion. No grades for participating in discussion forums. I'm unable to attend lectures in person. Is attendance mandatory ? Attendance is not mandatory. All sessions are recorded, however you do miss out on interaction with Professors and other students. Auditors Can I audit this course? This course is based on frequent interactions among teaching staff and students. Given the nature of the class, our policy is not to allow auditors.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/faq.html"},{"title":"Projects","text":"Previous projects You can find some examples of the projects developed by AC295 students during the previous iterations of this course on Medium in the publication curated by the Institute of Applied Computational Science and on the page dedicated to AC295 Projects .

Then we will build and deploy an application that uses the deep learning model to understand how to productionize models. This course follows the CS109 A/B model of balancing between concept, theory, and implementation. Split into three parts; the course starts with the review of Deep Learning concepts for data and modeling and how to apply them to different tasks, including vision and language tasks. The next part will be Development, where you use the models you trained in part 1 and incorporate them into real-world applications. Finally, you will Deploy the application in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The three parts will cover in detail topics such as Transfer learning, Containerization using Docker, and Scaling deployments using Kubernetes. At the end of this module, you will build efficient deep learning models and design, build and deploy applications that scale. Course Topics Project Outline: Introduction to Projects Problem Definition Proposed Solutions Project Scope Deep Learning: Data Data Pipelines TensorFlow Data TensorFlow Records Dask Cloud Storage Models Computer Vision: Classification Computer Vision: Segmentation NLP & Language Models Transfer Learning and SOTA Models Distillation and Compression Development: Design Virtual Environments, Virtual Machines Containers & Docker App Design Develop Setup and Code organization APIs and Model serving App frontend Operations: Deployment, Scaling, & Automation Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Ansible Prerequisites Your are expected to know the following: Good working knowledge of python Good understanding on the Tensorflow Deep Learning framework Basic shell commands Programming: Experience with Python: Functions, Classes, Modules, NumPy, Pandas, Tensorflow Basic Data Structures: Dictionaries and Lists File I/O Grading Breakdown Grading Breakdown Quiz 10% Exercises 20% Milestone 1 5% Milestone 2 15% Milestone 3 20% Final Presentation & Deliverable 30% Course Components The course includes the following every week: 2 Sessions (Tue, Thu) Office hours Sessions Before the Tuesday session begins, students are expected to complete a pre-class reading assignment and and attempt a quiz based on the same. The sessions will be one and half hours and will have the following layout: Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details. Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques. Part of the session will be an instructor driven in-depth implementation walk through of code related to the topics covered. This will help you understand the concepts and give you starter code that will help in your projects. Student participation is highly encouraged in sessions. Reading Assignments The course schedule includes weekly readings which will be available before the lecture. The goal of the reading assignments is to prepare for class, to familiarize yourself with new terminology and definitions, and to determine which part of the subject needs more attention. Each Tuesday session will have a short quiz at the beginning which covers the assigned reading for that week. Homework Code that cannot be completed in class will be left as an exercise for the student to complete as homework. We will go over hints to complete your homework which will be an individual effort. Project During the entire course you will work in teams and implement a project. The various topics in the class are designed to help you build milestones in an incremental fashion and build towards the end goal. The final outcome with your project will be a fully working AI App. Project groups need to be formed by the first week of class Group size : 4 Select a project from the list given or bring your own Criteria for projects are: Deep learning task implemented should include preferably both computer vision and language models The end product should be a deployable app that uses the models in the backend in some form If you plan to bring your own project idea, the following additional criteria must be met: Dataset size 5 Gigabytes or larger Data should include preferably images and text Please find a more detailed summary of all projects here. [TODO] Deadlines All quizzes are due before the next Tuesday session. All homework are due before the next Thursday session. There will be no extensions given for the homework and quizzes. The deadline for the project milestones will be announced in the scaffold. Software All softwares required for this course and installation instructions/help will be provided in first week. Course Policies Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: Post the question on ED and hopefully, your peers will answer. Note that questions on ED are visible to everyone. The teaching staff monitors the posts. Attend Office Hours, this is the best way to get help. For private matters send an email to the instructor. Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait, from ethically handling data to the attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC215, we give a strong emphasis on Academic Honesty. As a student, your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We have included some ideas below of acceptable and not acceptable behaviors. Engaging in not acceptable behavior regarding academic honesty will be handled accordingly. Please be responsible and when in doubt ask the course instructors. ACCEPTABLE: Discussing materials and engaging in OH. Helping debug. Using a few lines of code found online or another forum as long as you cite the origin and attribute authorship of code. Searching online to expand your knowledge and for debugging Using a tutor, provided the tutor does not do your work for you. NOT ACCEPTABLE: Accessing a solution to some problem prior to submitting your own. Failing to cite the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work. Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as your own. Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future. Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Pavlos by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 17. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Topics in Applied Computation: Advanced Practical Data Science, MLOps","text":"Fall 2021 Pavlos Protopapas Office Hours: By appointment Course helpline: ac215.fall2021@gmail.com Welcome to AC215: Advanced practical data science, MLOps.
